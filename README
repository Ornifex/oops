Introduction
==============================================================================

This is OOPS, the Object Oriented Prover for S5n. OOPS was created by [Elske
van der Vaart](http://www.ai.rug.nl/~elskevdv/) and [Gert van
Valkenhoef](http://www.gertvv.nl/) in the context of a [Multi-Agent
Systems](http://www.ai.rug.nl/mas/) project.

OOPS makes use of a tableau proof method in order to prove or disprove
formulas in the S5n modal logic. More information can be found on the
[OOPS wiki on GitHub](http://wiki.github.com/gertvv/oops).

To encourage future work on OOPS, the source code is available under the GNU
General Public License (GNU GPL). It is our hope that OOPS will be tested,
proven correct, extended or otherwise enhanced in the context of future
student projects.

Running OOPS
==============================================================================

To run OOPS from the provided ZIP file, you need Java version 1.5 or higher.

Example:

	$ java -jar dist/oops.jar script.lua


Compiling from source
==============================================================================

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build the sources in this directory you need:

  - [Sun Java](http://java.sun.com/) 1.5 or higher (or any compatible
implementation)
  - [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
  - [Maven2](http://maven.apache.org/)
  - [Maven2 ant-tasks](http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/).
    These need to be in your Ant path (e.g. $HOME/.ant/lib).

Any additional dependencies will be downloaded automatically via Maven.


Building the JAR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following command:

	 $ ant dist

This will create the file 'oops.jar' under the directory 'dist'. Running plain
'ant' will build the class files, but not the JAR.


Running the test suite
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following command:

	$ ant test

This will create a series of test reports in the directory 'test'.


Generating an Eclipse project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, set up Eclipse to work with Maven (this sets some variables in your
workspace):

	$ mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=$WORKSPACE

Then, in the OOPS sources folder, do

	$ ant oops-grammar
	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse

Import the project into Eclipse. Finally, add the parser/oops-parser.jar to
the project build path.

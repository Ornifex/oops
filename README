Introduction
==============================================================================

This is OOPS, the Object Oriented Prover for S5n. OOPS was created by [Elske
van der Vaart](http://www.ai.rug.nl/~elskevdv/) and [Gert van
Valkenhoef](http://www.gertvv.nl/) in the context of a [Multi-Agent
Systems](http://www.ai.rug.nl/mas/) project.

OOPS makes use of a tableau proof method in order to prove or disprove
formulas in the S5n modal logic. More information can be found on the
[OOPS wiki on GitHub](http://wiki.github.com/gertvv/oops).

To encourage future work on OOPS, the source code is available under the GNU
General Public License (GNU GPL). It is our hope that OOPS will be tested,
proven correct, extended or otherwise enhanced in the context of future
student projects.

Running OOPS
==============================================================================

To run OOPS from the provided ZIP file, you need Java version 1.5 or higher.

Example:

	$ java -jar oops.jar

Or simply double-click on oops.jar.


Compiling from source
==============================================================================

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to build the sources in this directory you need:

  - [Sun Java](http://java.sun.com/) 1.5 or higher (or any compatible
implementation)
  - [Maven2](http://maven.apache.org/)

Any additional dependencies will be downloaded automatically via Maven.

Getting the latest version from GitHub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed. Run the following
command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/gertvv/oops.git

Alternatively, go to http://github.com/gertvv/oops and see the downloads
section, where you can retrieve source for any of the released versions of
OOPS.

Building the JAR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do the following:

	$ cd parser
	$ mvn install

This will install the parser library to your local Maven2 repository. Then:

	$ cd application
	$ mvn package

This will create application/target/oops-$VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar,
which you can use to run OOPS.

Alternatively, the following will install OOPS to your Maven2 repository:

	$ mvn install


Running the test suite
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maven build automatically runs all provided unit tests (under src/test).
Test reports are generated under target/surefire-reports.

Generating an Eclipse project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, set up Eclipse to work with Maven (this sets some variables in your
workspace):

	$ mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=$WORKSPACE

Make sure the parser is installed in your local Maven2 repository (see above).
Then, do the following:

	$ cd application
	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse

Now, import the project into Eclipse.

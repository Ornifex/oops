Introduction
==============================================================================

This is OOPS, the Object Oriented Prover for S5n. OOPS was created by Elske
van der Vaart (http://www.ai.rug.nl/~elskevdv/) and Gert van Valkenhoef
(http://www.ai.rug.nl/~valkenhoef/) in the context of a Multi-Agent Systems
project (http://www.ai.rug.nl/mas/).

OOPS makes use of a tableau proof method in order to prove or disprove
formulas in the S5n modal logic. More information can be found in the
accompanying paper (http://www.ai.rug.nl/~valkenhoef/oops/).

To encourage future work on OOPS, the source code is available under the GNU
General Public License (GNU GPL). It is our hope that OOPS will be tested,
proven correct, extended or otherwise enhanced in the context of future
student projects.

Running OOPS
==============================================================================

To run OOPS from the provided JAR file, you need to have the following
installed (and have your classpath set up correctly):

 * Sun Java 1.5 or higher

Run the prover by (assuming oops.jar is in the current working directory):
	 $ java -cp oops.jar nl.rug.ai.mas.oops.Prover '<formula>'
Where <formula> is a valid formula according to the OOPS syntax (see the
accompanying paper).

Example:
	 $ java -cp oops.jar nl.rug.ai.mas.oops.Prover 'a | ~a'
	true


Compiling from source
==============================================================================

Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to build the sources in this directory you need:

Sun Java 1.5 or higher (or any compatible implementation)
http://java.sun.com/

Apache Ant, 1.6.5 has been tested
http://ant.apache.org/

SableCC, version 3.2 (supporting generics) or higher
SableCC ant task, version 1.0.1 or higher
http://sablecc.org/

Junit4, version 4.3.1 has been tested (although any 4.x should be sufficient)
http://junit.org/

Follow the installation instructions _carefully_ and make sure all the
required JAR files are in your path.


Building the JAR
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following command:
	 $ ant dist

This will create the file 'oops.jar' under the directory 'dist'.

Running plain 'ant' will build the class files, but not the JAR.


Running the test suite
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following command:
	$ ant test

This will create a series of test reports in the directory 'test'.

Introduction
==============================================================================

This is OOPS, the Object Oriented Prover for S5n. OOPS was created by Elske
van der Vaart (http://www.ai.rug.nl/~elskevdv/) and Gert van Valkenhoef
(http://www.ai.rug.nl/~valkenhoef/) in the context of a Multi-Agent Systems
project (http://www.ai.rug.nl/mas/).

OOPS makes use of a tableau proof method in order to prove or disprove
formulas in the S5n modal logic. More information can be found in the
accompanying paper (http://www.ai.rug.nl/~valkenhoef/oops/).

\begin{abstract}
We present \oops, an open source, cross-platform, easy-to-run tableau prover
for $S5_n$.
\oops\ is aimed at education in modal logics.
Thus, it has several features that enable insight into its internal workings.
Specifically, \oops\ allows tableaux to be visualized and can generate counter
models for formulas that are not provable.
Moreover, the \oops\ Graphical User Interface (GUI) increases ease of use
and an integrated general purpose scripting language (Lua) is used to provide
convenient and powerful interactions with the \oops\ tableau generator.
